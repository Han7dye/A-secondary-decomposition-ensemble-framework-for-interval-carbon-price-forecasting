The txt documentations are datasets as input into the main forecasting function. 
Take HBEA as example, hb.txt is the original interval data, hbl.txt and hbu.txt are primarily decomposed IMFs, hb2l.txt and hb2u.txt are IMFs after secondary decomposition. 
main_SSA_iMLP.m and main_iMLP.m are main forecasting precedures. 
The others are auxiliary functions that would be called while running the main m documents.
